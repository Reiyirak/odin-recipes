      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="description">
        This Mexican flan recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law, who is
        from Durango, Mexico. I had to beg her for years to give me this custard
        recipe — she finally gave it to me one Christmas. I like to add orange
        zest, but the original dessert recipe calls for just pure vanilla.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li class="ingredient">1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li class="ingredient">3 large eggs</li>
        <li class="ingredient">3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li class="ingredient">¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 tablespoon grated orange zest</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 cup heavy cream</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li class="step">
          Place sugar into a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook,
          stirring constantly, until sugar melts and turns a golden amber color,
          about 10 minutes. Watch carefully once syrup begins to change color
          because it burns quickly. Carefully pour caramel syrup into a flan
          mold. Set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li class="step">
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place an oven rack
          in the middle position.
        </li>
        <li class="step">
          Place sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, eggs, egg yolks, orange
          juice, orange zest, vanilla, and cornstarch into a blender; blend
          until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour in cream and pulse several times to
          incorporate. Pour mixture over cooled caramel syrup in the flan mold.
        </li>
        <li class="step">
          Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel. Place the filled flan
          mold carefully on the towel in the roasting pan, then place the
          roasting pan on the oven rack. Fill the roasting pan with enough
          boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the flan mold.
        </li>
        <li class="step">
          Bake in the preheated oven until the center of flan is set but still
          slightly jiggles when nudged, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool, then
          refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li class="step">
          To serve, run a sharp paring knife around the inside of the mold to
          release flan. Place a serving plate on the mold, then flip the mold
          over. Gently lift the mold to release flan and allow caramel syrup to
          cascade over custard. Remove the mold.
        </li>
